                <h2 class="blog-title">REACTIONS TO WEEK 2</h2>
                <p class="blog-content">
                    <span class="make-font">The Minnesota Vikings suffered an unfortunate defeat Thursday night in Philadelphia where self-inflicted wounds were a main component in the loss. <br><br>On the offensive side there were plenty of highlights to go around. Kirk Cousins played a great game tallying 364 passing yards and 4 touchdowns, Justin Jefferson had 11 catches and 159 yards, rookie Jordan Addison had 3 catches for 72 yards and a touchdown. The lack of consistency in the offense this week was due to turnovers. <br><br>Punt-Returner Brandon Powell kicked off the Vikings fumble show on a return which looked promising as he totaled roughly 20 yards before getting the ball punched out. A few drives later an Alexander Mattison fumble gave the ball right back to Philadelphia after the defense had come up with a momentum swinging interception just a few plays beforehand. With less than a minute to play in the first half the Vikings trailed 7-10 but looked as though the offense had found it's rhythm. A Kirk Cousins pass down the left sideline to Justin Jefferson looked as though it would allow the Vikings to take the lead heading into halftime, however after Jefferson made an acrobatic play to catch the ball, he proceeded to fumble the ball reaching for the endzone. The ball then flew over the pylon and out of bounds in the endzone. This unfortunately invoked one of the more confusing rules in football. If the offensive team fumbles the ball out of the endzone, it is ruled a touchback and the opposing team gets the ball. A soul crushing finish to the half as with 34 seconds left Philly was able to get into field goal range and extend their lead to 13-7 as time expired. <br><br> A hot start was needed out of the gate in the second half; however, the opposite was achieved. The offensive line continued to be a liability as on the second snap of the second half, backup left tackle Oli Udoh was left in the dust by Eagles defensive end Josh Sweat, who proceeded to sack Cousins, force a fumble, and a few plays later the Eagles had extended their lead to 20-7. Four fumbles and a negative 3 turnover margin will not win you football games in the NFL. A valiant effort was made to come back in the second half, but the turnovers were too difficult to overcome. <br><br> Multiple times in the 4th quarter it was brought to a one score game, however Vikings fans were reminded repeatedly that our defensive line was no match for the Eagles offensive line. When the Eagles had to, they could run the ball whenever they wanted for as many yards as they wanted. With all this being said, the Vikings were still a successful onside kick away from having the ball back with 2 timeouts and roughly a minute to go in a 6-point game. There's lots of good and lots of bad to take away from weeks 1 and 2, but all that matters is the win column still has a 0, and the loss column is only getting bigger. The sense of urgency will continue to grow as the previous NFC North champions are looking at an 0-2 start to their season knowing the schedule doesn't get any easier from here.
